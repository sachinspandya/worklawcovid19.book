# Preface {-}

This book is a first stab by a group of researchers to expose and explain the ways that COVID-19 has thus far affected work law in the US, both on the books and on the ground. The focus is on the US with a comparative look at few other countries. This book, like the virus, is ongoing. We aim to _update_ the book relatively quickly (as best we can) as events and information change. To that end, feel free to send comments and suggestions to a contribution's author, or to the editors at <mailto: sachin.pandya@uconn>.

## Why read this book {-}

We've published this book for anyone with a reliable Internet connection who wants to know more about COVID-19's effect on workers and work law (in the US and elsewhere) but has neither the training nor the patience to mine the law or traditional legal commentary for insights. Accordingly, the contributions are relatively short, but each one has hyperlinks to cited primary and secondary sources, in case you wnat to dig deeper. The focus is mostly on the United States. For country-level reports on labor law and COVID-19, see @Haar2020. 

## Colophon {-}
