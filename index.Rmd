# Preface {-}

This book is a first stab at explaining the ways that COVID-19 has thus far affected work law -- mostly in the U.S. with a comparative look at few other countries. The book is a work in progress. Just as the pandemic is ongoing, we are adding and updating contributions to this book as we go as events and information change. To that end, feel free to [email](mailto: worklawcovid@uconn) comments and suggestions -- including what we missed and what we got wrong.

## Why read this book {-}

This book is for you if you want to know more about COVID-19's effect on work law, but don't have the training, time, or patience to read the law itself or traditional legal commentary. As a result, the contributions are relatively short, but with links to cited primary and secondary sources if you want to dig deeper. The focus is mostly on the United States with a few cross-country comparisons.

## Colophon {-}

This book was built with `r R.version.string` and bookdown [@R-bookdown].

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# needed because new_session is set to true in _bookdown.yml

library(dplyr)
all_pkgs <- renv::dependencies() %>% 
  pull(Package) 
session <- devtools::session_info(pkgs = all_pkgs)
session$platform
```

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
all_pkgs <- renv::dependencies(progress = FALSE) %>% 
  pull(Package) 

session <- devtools::session_info(pkgs = all_pkgs)

session$packages %>% 
  #select(package, loadedversion, date, source) %>% 
  select(package, date, source) %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE,
                class = 'cell-border stripe',
                filter = list(position = 'top'),
                options = list(pageLength = 25, 
                           autoWidth = TRUE,
                           bInfo = FALSE,
