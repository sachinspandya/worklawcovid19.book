	abstract = {The Australian regulatory response to the COVID-19 pandemic initially involved high levels of cooperation between all levels of government, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and key business groups. The impacts of business closures and restricted operations were quickly seen through widespread stand downs and, increasingly, layoffs of workers. A wage subsidy scheme for affected employees (JobKeeper) left out many casual and migrant workers. Norms of workplace regulation were rapidly adapted to allow businesses to adjust operations and many employees to work from home, while those working in essential sectors contended with overwork and safety concerns. The economy opened up again as the infection rate was brought under control, only to be followed by the re-imposition of even stricter controls in the state of Victoria due to a surge in COVID-19 cases. Four months into the crisis, the early consensus approach to appropriate regulatory settings for employment relations is under significant strain. Contestation over the shape and extent of industrial relations reform has re-emerged, as it becomes clearer that business interests and conservative political forces seek to utilise the pandemic to advance a deregulatory agenda.},

The contribution of this article is twofold. Firstly, we demonstrate divergence in union strategies, distinguishing between (i) a ‘traditional self-reliant’ strategy, where unions recruit temporary migrant workforces by using established methods and their own resources and (ii) network collectivism, where unions also engage with temporary migrant workforces obliquely through external social media platforms and alliances. Our second contribution is to examine how the components of network collectivism interact as an integrated strategy for temporary migrant worker mobilisation. }

abstract = { Early in 2019, in anticipation of a change in Federal government, the fate of unions and collective bargaining in Australia appeared likely to take a new direction. However, the re-election in May of the Morrison-led Coalition government changed all this. This article reviews the year in three main sections, focusing respectively on unions and union strategy; collective bargaining and collective agreements; and public policy, unions and collective bargaining. Despite some interesting twists, the overall themes are more of the same – the continuation of political partisanship towards unions and collective bargaining, and the reinforcement of adversarialism in the workplace. }
